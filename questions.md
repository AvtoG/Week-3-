1) one major advantage of using an object over multiple variables is that by creating and using an object,
    you won't have to rewrite multiple lines of code in order to achieve the same goal. 

2) the role of the parameters in an object is to dictate what variables will be changed when an object
    gets called (which contains the argument for the parameters). essentially they're variables that haven't
    been plugged in yet. 
    
3) when a functino is returning something, it mean's its returning a value to the programmer, like when 
    random() get's called, it returns random values between a set parameter.
